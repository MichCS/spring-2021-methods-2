# Asynchronous Activities

### Session 10: 4/28
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Create a post describing what you feel the purpose of homework is, and what kinds of assignments match that purpose.

### Session 8: 4/07
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * In a remote teaching environment, it's easy to use tools like peardeck to get immediate and private feedback to help guide your lesson. Alex did a great job explaining how he uses that data when teaching. Give some options of how you could gatehr that same kind of infomration during an in-person class (consider the students don't all have access to a computer, so using peardeck wouldn't work).

### Session 7: 3/24
In the \#meth2_async channel either:
  * Find an active open source project that you could show to a class you are/would be in the future teaching.
  * Share a link to the project in general, along with a link to the project's feedback apparatus (on github, this would be found under Issues) that shows a contributor providing a feature/patch/bugfix that was approved and added to the main program.

### Session 6: 3/17
In the \#meth2_async channel either:
  * Think of a language or tool used in either a class you teach or class you have taken. Tell us the tool and the class.
  * Did the class leverage the strength of that particular tool? How so (or not so)?

### Session 5: 3/10
Work on your [demo lesson snippet](demos.md)

### Session 4: 3/3
Watch the following video on differentiation (1 hour): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNpEtrulPIg&t=190s
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Provide 2 specific strategies suggested that you think are useful. What was it about them that appealed to you?

### Session 3: 2/24
* Listen to the following podcast on grading (35 minutes): https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/15/season-2-episode-4-grading-for-equity/
* In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Provide your reaction to the suggestions made in the episode. Do you agree with the general sentiment or not? Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
  * For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

### Session 2: 2/17
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Post 2 data sets that are of interest to you.
  * Describe what you would like to do with the data.
  * Some places to get started:
      - https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets
      - https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday

### Session 1: 2/10
In the \#meth2_async curdev channel:
  * Look over the [NY State Standards for Computer Science and Digital Fluenc](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards)
    - Pages 12-17 of [the full standards document](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf) give an overview of each core concept.

  * What do you feel is missing from them?
