## Logistical Stuff
  * GH classroom
    - work repo link: https://classroom.github.com/a/pk9TcOqe
    - If work can be a text, it should be .md file
    - python files when needed
  * Repo of goodness: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2

# Python!
  * Why python?
  * Suggested reference: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html
  * Suggested environment: [thonny](https://thonny.org)

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Breakout room! Programming pairs (but not quite pair programming)

:small_orange_diamond:  One person should be typing & sharing screen.
:small_orange_diamond:  All teammates should be actively discussing the problems & solutions.
:small_orange_diamond:  Each team will have a problem from project euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives) to solve.
:small_orange_diamond:  Write python code to get the solution for your problem.
:small_orange_diamond:  Be prepared to show your code when we reconvene.
:small_orange_diamond:  React with :glitch_crab: when done

### Async
  * Look over the [NY State Standards for Computer Science and Digital Fluenc](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards)
    - Pages 12-17 of [the full standards document](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-digital-fluency-standards-k-12.pdf) give an overview of each core concept.
  * What do you think are the aims of these standards?
  * What do you feel is missing from them?

### Assignment
  * title: **euler**
  * In a single python file, write solutions to the following project euler problems:
    - 1, 2, 5, 6
  * Write a function that returns the solution for each given problem.
    - for for example, running `problem1(10)` would return `23`
    - You may write helper functions and organize your code however you'd like.
  * Answers:
    - Problem 001: 233168
    - Problem 002: 4613732
    - Problem 005: 232792560
