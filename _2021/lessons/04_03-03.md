## startup
  * Brief recap of the grading for equity async
    - Lisa: Teachers arent truested to impliment this
      - grades for non content are baked into the DOE
    - Pat & Lisa: Time to do any of this
      - overly general rubrics
    - Emma: Already doing this!
      - tell us more
      - what level of granularity in the rubrics?
  * Demo lesson snippets: starting next week
    - 1st ~10 minutes of a lesson
      - different structures
      - doesn't have to be exactly 10 minutes, but looking for warmup/do now/motivation + introduction to topic
    - introducing boolean values (in python)
      - assume students know python arithmetic, function syntax, print function
    - introducing the if statement in python
      - assume students know python arithmetic, function syntax, print function, boolean values, comparison operators, boolean operators.
    - using if/elif/else
      - assume students know python arithmetic, function syntax, print function, boolean values, comparison operators, boolean operators, if statement


## Classroom management
  - what is its purpose?
    - keep students engaged on the material
    - if they're engaged, they wont be doing other things
  - differntiation discussion
    - what is its purpose
      - keep students engaged
      - meet needs of various students
    - some strategies
      - scaffolding
      - different groups
      - different goals
      - open problems

```
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Breakout task
* Open up the python data lab assignment here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/blob/main/resources/04_diff/csv_lab.md
* What concrete measures could you take to differentiate this assignment for students at different levels of ability?
* For convenience, there is a solution for this lab here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/blob/main/resources/04_diff/csv_lab_solved.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```


### Async
Watch the following video on differentiation (1 hour): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNpEtrulPIg&t=190s
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Provide 2 specific strategies suggested that you think are useful. What was it about them that appealed to you?


### Assignment
  * title **think_different**
    - Open up the python data lab assignment here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/blob/main/resources/04_diff/csv_lab.md
    - Create a scaffolded python file for this assignment.
    - Note at the top of your python file what level your scaffolding is designed for.
    - Also provide a potential extension that you could assign students that complete the assignment quickly.
    - You can put this all in a python file, or separate some instructions out in a markdown file as well.
