### Async
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Create a post describing what you feel the purpose of homework is, and what kinds of assignments match that purpose.

### Assignment
  * title **groups**
  * You've assigned a large, open-ended, 4 person group project. Come up with some strategies to make sure that work is being done equitably amongst the group.
  * Some situations to consider (as well as others)
    - A student takes total control over the group and does most/all of the work.
    - A student disengages from group and does little/no work.
    - Students are willing to do work, but have to wait for other parts of the project to be done first, so they have nothing to do.
    - Students work on the project together mostly, but at the end one student puts in a lot of work (to fix a bug, add pet feature ...)
  * In addition to managing group dynamics, time managent is important in long term projects. Come up with some strategies that will help students use their time wisely.
