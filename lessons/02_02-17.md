## Discussion: What is a data driven assignment?
Points:
  * Get real world Data
    - Lots of data types out there:
      - Sports stats, books, scientific data, media (song, movie, steaming) data
  * What are benefits of a data driven assignment?
    - Students can see real application of CS
    - Huge amount of data available, students could find what is of interest to them.
    - Critical thinking: can you use the data to make a point?
  * Potential pitfalls
    - Finding good Data
      - Finding _clean_ Data, _free_ Data
    - Too much data?

### Assignment
  * title: **data**
  * Create an in-class assignment for using real world data.
    - You can include a homwork/day 2 extension to it, but it shouldn't be a large project.
    - This does not need to be a programming assignment.
  * Create a potential full-credit submission for your assignment.
  * To submit, create a folder in your classwork repository called **02_data**
    - Put all the files for your submission here.
    - Include any solution files (these may vary depending on the assignment).
