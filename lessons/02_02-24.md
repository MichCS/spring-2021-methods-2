## Logistical Stuff
  * GH classroom
    - work repo link: https://classroom.github.com/a/pk9TcOqe
    - If work can be a text, it should be .md file
    - python files when needed
  * Repo of goodness: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2


## Discussion: why do we have grades?
  * Was not originally part of this syllabus, added after a discussion with Z
    - grading can be real personal
    - not a lot of training in it
    - dichotomy of teachers being given a lot of freedom in how they grade, yet being expected to meet certain quotas or other goals.
  * Purpose of grades?
  * Problem: lots of different reasons, some beyond our control

## What is being measured?
  * Homework / Classwork
  * Tests / Projects
  * What is the purpose of each?
  * How would you grade each?


### Async
Listen to the following podcast on grading (35 minutes): https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/15/season-2-episode-4-grading-for-equity/
In the \#meth2_async channel:
  * Provide your reaction to the suggestions made in the episode. Do you agree with the general sentiment or not? Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
  * For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?


### Assignment
  * Add a new file to your directory from the work for session 02 called **grading.md**
  * Explain how you would grade the assignment.
