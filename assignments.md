# Assignments
#### Use the Following GitHub Classroom link to create your assignment repositories: COMING SOON
#### All text-based assignments should be copleted in a markdown file with the following naming convention: session_title.md e.g. 00_goodnbad.md
#### Some assignments will require python files, or multiple files. In those cases, file types and naming will be specified in the assignment.

### Session 8: 4/07
  * title **tdd**
  * Create a programming task in python that requires students to write a complex function.
    - The function should have multiple potential results based on different inputs.
  * Write a series of tests that could be used to direct your students through this function using Test Driven Development.
    - Include full versions of your function that would satisfy the given test. So if you have 6 tests, there should be 6 versions of the function.
  * Write a programming task for students that asks them to use Test Driven Design.
    - Different from berfore, the whole task should be provided for the students.
    - Also different, the students need to come up with the tests.
    - An important thing to consider is.

### Session 7: 3/24
  * title **google**
  * Create a programming task in python that involves using strings and lists in some way.
    - This desciprtion is purposefully ambiguous to allow for creativity.
    - The task should involve multiple steps, ~5.
  * Run a few internet searches that a student might run when presented with your task.
  * In a markdown file:
    - Describe the task
    - For each search you ran provide three links from the results
      - Provide a critique on the result. Things to consider:
        - Was it useful?
        - Was it too simple/complex?
        - Was it unecessarily compicated?
        - Did it include copypastable code?
        - Did you learn from it/could a student learn from it?

### Session 6: 3/17
  * title **strengths**
  * Select a programming language/tool to create a lesson with.
  * Create a lesson that demonstrates the strength(s) of the chosen language/tool.
  * The lesson should have:
    - Description of a tool to be used and how this lesson is demonstrating its strengths.
    - Goal/Aim/Objective
    - Warm up/Do Now/Opening question
    - Content to be learned
      - This could take the form of a lesson/mini-lesson, or be built into a planned in class assignment.
    - Some in-class assignment/practice.

### Session 5: 3/10
  * title **daily_digital**
  * Go out in the world, and find a piece of current tech news
    - As Alex noted: relevancy is key, old articles can be "current".
  * In a markdown document, provide the following informaiton about your news:
    - source(s)
    - breif description
      - cover the major points, imaigne you were going to lead a ~5min discussion on this, what should you cover to do so
    - why did you select this story?
  * In addition to your news and writeup, provide 3 websites that you would send students to in order to find good tech news.


### Session 4: 3/3
  * title **think_different**
    - Open up the python data lab assignment here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/blob/main/resources/04_diff/csv_lab.md
    - Create a scaffolded python file for this assignment.
    - Note at the top of your python file what level your scaffolding is designed for.
    - Also provide a potential extension that you could assign students that complete the assignment quickly.
    - You can put this all in a python file, or separate some instructions out in a markdown file as well.
    - For convenience, there is a solution for this lab here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/blob/main/resources/04_diff/csv_lab_solved.py

### Session 3: 2/24
* Add a new file to your directory from the work for session 02 called **grading.md**
* Explain how you would grade the assignment you created.

### Session 2: 2/17
  * title: **data**
  * Create an in-class assignment for using real world data.
    - You can include a homwork/day 2 extension to it, but it shouldn't be a large project.
    - This does not need to be a programming assignment.
  * Create a potential full-credit submission for your assignment.
  * To submit, create a folder in your classwork repository called **02_data**
    - Put all the files for your submission here.
    - Include any solution files (these may vary depending on the assignment).
    - Put the assignment instructions in a file called README.md
      - At the top, include a list of other files in this directory along with a description

### Session 1: 2/10
  * title: **euler**
  * In a single python file, write solutions to the following project euler problems:
    - 1, 2, 5, 6
  * Write a function that returns the solution for each given problem.
    - for for example, running `problem1(10)` would return `23`
    - You may write helper functions and organize your code however you'd like.
  * Answers:
    - Problem 001: 233168
    - Problem 002: 4613732
    - Problem 005: 232792560
    - Problem 006: 25164150

### Session 0: 2/03
  * title: **goodnbad**
  * Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went poorly.
    - Why do you think it didn't go well?
    - What would you do (have you done) to make it better?
  * Describe an instance when you were teaching somthing computer science related and it went really well.
    - Why do you think it went so well?
  * These examples could come from normal classes, presentations, tutoring sessions, helping a friend, as long as you were teaching, it can count.
